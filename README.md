# chrome-extension-udemybookmarkkiller

Removes inline video bookmark elements from Udemy, whose presence causes a persistence bug when skipping around the videos and is a huge annoyance of mine.

Install extension by entering the Extension menu in Chrome or Brave, and activating developer mode. Select 'Load unpacked', and select the local project directory.

Code is built for Manifest Version 3, and utilizes service worker for event handling.
